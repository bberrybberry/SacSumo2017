# SacSumo2017
Collection of design notes, Schemantic/PCB files, and code for MSP430-based sumo robot. Used at competition in 2017 IEEE Region 2 SAC


## THE DESIGN

Design notes are currently kept either offline or in our shared drive. Parts order sheet will be posted here after design is complete

## THE PCB

The PCB is designed in DipTrace.

## THE CODE

The bot is designed around the MSP430f5529 microcontroller. It will be heavily based on driverlib in MSPWARE.
